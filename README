--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see some examples: 

$ cd examples
$ python triplets_app.py

This example is a interesting demo that uses tk_utils, security, and tkinter2x.

$ python test_dictionaries.py

This example is a demo/test of dictionaries.UpdatingDict() and 
dictionaries.SortedDict().

$ python test_libs.py

This example is a demo/test of math_utils, iter_utils, file_utils, and 
security. Can easily and most likely will be extended in the future.

$ python metagui.py

This example is a GUI implementation of an OGG and MP3 tag editor. It uses 
dictionaries.GUIDict(), but requires mutagen for tag loading.

More examples are desired, so if you make a small program heavily using this 
library that you would like to share, please send it to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to contribute to PGPU in any way, whether through bug 
reports, bug fixes, better code, or new code altogether, please follow these 
instructions:


1) If you are sending a large amount of code, please make a Git diff and email 
   it to me. Otherwise, go to the website given above and follow the standard 
   procedures. There is a special tab for bugs.

2) If you sent an email, just watch your inbox. If I want more information, I 
   will tell you. If I thought it was worthy, I will thank you and get you up 
   in the AUTHORS file, etc. If I didn't think it was worthwhile or that it 
   wouldn't fit in, I will thank you anyways. If you used Github, do the same 
   things, but watch the website instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use this library to do something useful, be sure to let me know! 
Sometimes a short "Good work!" message is enough to make a programmer feel 
rewarded. And of course, "Wrote a library that was used in X many other 
people's projects" always looks good on a resume!

* The www.python-forum.com community, for helping me learn the RIGHT way to 
    code in Python
