PGPU is distributed under the GPLv2 (or greater), see COPYING for details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see some examples: 

$ cd examples
$ python triplets_app.py

This example is a interesting demo that uses tk_utils, security, and tkinter2x

$ python test_dictionaries.py

This example is a demo/test of dictionaries.UpdatingDict() and 
dictionaries.SortedDict()

$ python metagui.py

This example is a GUI implementation of an OGG and MP3 tag editor. It uses 
dictionaries.GUIDict(), but requires mutagen for tag loading.

More examples are desired, so if you make a small program heavily using this 
library that you would like to share, please send it to pydsigner@gmail.com.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to contribute to PGPU in any way, whether through bug 
reports, bug fixes, better code, or new code altogether, please follow these 
steps:

1) Make sure that you have the latest version. The latest version is not always 
	directly available, so ask me for it if there is not already one available 
	to you.

2) Send the entire thing to me via email.

3) If I like it, I will integrate it into PGPU, add you to the AUTHORS file, 
	and notify you. If not, don't give up. I will give you a reason: maybe 
	I didn't think it fit in, contained errors, or other such things. Many of 
	these can be fixed. For example, at least at this point, I want to avoid 
	large amounts of external dependencies, so I would likely turn down a 
	pygame utility module, but accept a similar module for tkinter.

Thanks to:
* Mark Lutz, for inspiring the tk_utils.STextPlus() widget
* The www.python-forum.com community, for helping me learn the RIGHT way to 
	code in Python
* The PGU packagers, for a package I could base mine off of
* The FIFE packagers, for a package clearing up some of my questions
