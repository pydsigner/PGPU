--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see some examples: 

$ cd examples

And then:

$ python triplets_app.py

This example is a interesting demo that uses tk_utils, security, and tkinter2x.

$ python test_dictionaries.py

This example is a demo/test of dictionaries.UpdatingDict() and 
dictionaries.SortedDict().

$ python test_libs.py

This example is a demo/test of math_utils, iter_utils, file_utils, and 
security. Can easily and most likely will be extended in the future.

$ python metagui.py

This example is a GUI implementation of an OGG and MP3 tag editor. It uses 
dictionaries.GUIDict(), but requires mutagen for tag loading.

More examples are desired, so if you make a small program heavily using this 
library that you would like to share, please send it to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to contribute to PGPU in any way, whether through bug 
reports, bug fixes, better code, or new code altogether, please follow these 
instructions:


1) If you are sending a large amount of code, please make a Git diff and email 
   it to me. Otherwise, go to the website given above and follow the standard 
   procedures. There is a special tab for bugs.

2) If you sent an email, just watch your inbox. If I want more information, I 
   will tell you. If I thought it was worthy, I will thank you and get you up 
   in the AUTHORS file, etc. If I didn't think it was worthwhile or that it 
   wouldn't fit in, I will thank you anyways. If you used Github, do the same 
   things, but watch the website instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use this library to do something useful, be sure to let me know! It is 
important to me to know what sort of user base my libraries have before making 
major interface changes.

* The www.python-forum.com community, for helping me learn the RIGHT way to 
  code in Python
* The PGU packagers, for a package I could base mine off of
* The FIFE packagers, for a package clearing up some of my questions
